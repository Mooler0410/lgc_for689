# lgc_for689

This is the code for the final project for *CSCE689 Algorithms and Optimization for Graph Mining (2021 Fall)*.

Team members: Hongye Jin, Keqiang Yan, Haoran Liu and Xuan Zhang.

The code is originally based on https://github.com/provezano/lgc. To run the notebooks, you need to download CIFAR-10 from the offical website (python version), and then extract it to the folder 'cifar10'.

`QiangXuanRanYe.ipynb` includes experiments for the original Zhou's diffusion algorithm using the affinity matrix.

`QiangXuanRanYe_knn.ipynb` includes experiments for the Zhou's diffusion algorithm using densified k-NN adjacency matrices.

`show.ipynb` is for visualization and `results/` includes all experimental results.
